# Blender-ImperialSnapping
Adds additional subdivisions to the orthographic view grid when using imperial measurements.

This addon is a modified version originally, though incompletely, created by Tristan L. This version has significant enhancements to usability and properly implements its functionality. Tested on Blender 4.1.
